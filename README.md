My name is Courage Tsikudo the Bluemarket experience developer

Bluemarket is an e-commerce website that specialises in organic vegetabls and fruit
sales

The project focuses on creating an e-commerce website to show your products in order for 
clients to be able to purchase by adding the products to a cart that does a calculation of the 
cost and then the client will be able to checkout.

Some features of the website are the home page the shop the full shop detail and the contact page
Each page is responsive.

Technologies used in this development are HTML, JavaScript, Mongo DB for the datatbase handling 
and CSS for styling.

I am poised to making this site become a reality by improving further.
I welcome all your suggestions and motivations

Thank you.

Best regards,
